If you’re thinking about giving your car seats a fresh new look, you’ve probably wondered the same thing as everyone else: **“How long will my car be stuck at the workshop?”**

The seat rewrap process can seem complicated, but at Five Star Auto Leather, the downtime is much shorter than you think. For most cars, your entire rewrap is **done in under a day**.

If you’re in a hurry, check out our reel below for a quick visual overview. But if you want the full scoop, here’s exactly how the Five Star process works. Spoiler: It’s only 3 steps.

## Step 1: Consultation — 15 Minutes is All We Need

The process begins with a short, hands-on consultation at our workshop. In just 15 minutes, you’ll be able to:

- Touch and compare material samples
- Explore textures, stitching and custom details that perfectly match your car
- Receive expert guidance from our team to finalise your design

> 💼 **Too busy to drop by?** No problem — we can handle the entire consultation via WhatsApp while maintaining the same level of guidance and support.

## Step 2: Production — 4 to 5 Days (Without Leaving Your Car)

Next, your covers go into production. This takes around four to five working days, but here’s the best part: you don’t need to leave your car with us yet.

Your car stays with you while our Batam production team does all the heavy lifting:

- Cutting the materials according to your car model
- Sewing the covers to your exact specifications
- Preparing everything to be shipped to Singapore

## Step 3: Installation — Full Transformation in Just One Day

Once your covers arrive in Singapore, you can bring your car in for installation. A typical timeline looks like this:

- 9AM — Car arrives at the workshop
- 9:30AM — Seats are fully dismantled
- 10AM to 3PM — New leather covers are installed
- 3:30PM — Seats are reinstalled
- 4PM — Final inspection and cleaning. Your car is ready to hit the road!

> ⚡️ **Fast Fact:** Seven-seater car installations take slightly longer than a five-seater, but are still completed within the same day.

## Convenience Beyond Working Hours

Can’t take leave from work? No problem. Busy customers can drop off or collect their car outside normal operating hours by leaving or collecting their car key in our secure lockbox. Your car, your schedule, no compromises.

## Why Our Downtime Is So Short

Our efficiency comes from years of building a vast library of seat templates for different car models in Singapore. This means we don’t have to trial-and-error your covers – we just place an order with our production and they craft it precisely.

> 💎 **Rare car model?** For less common models, we create a new template by removing your existing seat covers. We can fix back the “naked” car seats so your car remains fully drivable. The seats may not look perfect temporarily, but function is never compromised.

## Final Thoughts: Your Time Matters And We Respect That

At the end of the day, we know your car isn’t just a vehicle – it’s part of your daily routine. That’s why we’ve refined our process to be smooth, convenient and hassle-free, without compromising on craftsmanship.

Leave your car in our capable hands. Your car deserves nothing less than a **#fivestarmakeover**
