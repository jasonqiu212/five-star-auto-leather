Let’s face it — the world of car leather can be confusing. Most of us aren’t experts who can name every chemical or molecular detail, and you shouldn’t have to do. What you _do_ need is enough knowledge to avoid getting sweet-talked by salespeople and to choose the right material for your lifestyle.

Here’s a clear, easy guide to the main types of automotive leather available in Singapore, and how to tell them apart yourself.

## 1. PVC

PVC is the most affordable option on the market. It is made out of a fabric base topped with a layer of Polyvinyl Chloride (thus the name PVC) which is a synthetic plastic polymer. It is the go-to option for commercial vehicles and rental fleets that need durability without the cost.

          <li>Leather-like grain but slightly artificial finish</li>
          <li>Firmer and more plastic to touch</li>

        <p>PVC is tougher than its reputation — it handles scratches, abrasions, and rough daily use well. But when it finally wears out, PVC typically shows damage by cracking and peeling.</p>
        <p>At Five Star, we use 1.1mm high quality PVC, thicker and sturdier than typical market versions.</p>

## 2. Cowhide Leather

Cowhide leather car interiors are increasingly uncommon these days. While we do not discount the advantages of cowhide, the prevalence of high-quality eco-friendly alternatives have made even the luxury car manufacturers rethink their strategies – just check out Artico leather used by Mercedes and Nuluxe by Lexus.

      <td>Look & Feel</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Soft, strong and premium to the touch</li>
          <li>Naturally breathable</li>
          <li>Lower grade hides may show scars or flaws</li>
          <li>Colors tend to be more muted than synthetics</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Maintenance</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Requires proper leather cleaners & conditioners</li>
          <li>Needs routine care to stay supple</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Durability</td>
      <td>Top grade cowhide can last for a long time. With proper conditioning, it develops a rich patina over time. But if neglected, it can dry out and eventually crack, especially under constant sunlight and daily contact with human sweat.</td>

## 3. Microfiber Leather

Microfiber leather is a next-gen vegan alternative that replicates the premium look and feel as cowhide, minus the cruelty, maintenance hassles and environmental footprint.

At Five Star, we specialise exclusively in top-tier automotive-grade microfiber leather. Crafted from ultra-fine fibres coated with high performance polyurethane resins, our leather is not only soft and supple to touch, but also clean to clean, UV- and scratch-resistant – engineered for modern car interiors.

      <td>Look & Feel</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
<li>Soft, supple and lightweight</li>

<li>Vibrant, consistent colors</li>
        </ul>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Maintenance</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Minimal maintenance</li>
          <li>Spill proof and easy to clean</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Durability</td>
      <td>
        <p>Quality microfiber leather is flexible yet strong. It doesn’t crack – instead, it gradually wears down with years of use. Plus, modern high-performance coatings also enhance:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scratch & abrasion resistance</li>
          <li>Stain resistance</li>
          <li>UV protection</li>
          <li>Air permeability</li>
        </ul>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

> ⚠️ **Note:** Do not confuse microfiber leather with PU leather used for furniture. PU has a fabric base and lower-grade resin that can’t survive sun exposure and high heat inside a car.
