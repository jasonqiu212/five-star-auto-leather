        These are the three pillars our Co-Presidents, Mr Mensono and Mdm Ang Poh Tin, have built
        Five Star Auto Leather on. Their story began in 1984 in Batam, Indonesia. With nothing but
        dreams of making a better living for their family, they tried every business idea they had –
        selling electronics, watches and even car accessories. For 12 years, they struggled to make
        ends meet.

        Opportunity came to them in 2006, when they ventured into Singapore with a potential
        business partner. They started with refurbishing deregistered cars which were exported for
        sale. It was difficult work which often required them to labour into late hours of the
        night, sewing in a dark factory. But our Co-Presidents persevered and their hard work paid
        off.

        Five Star Auto Leather was then born, furnishing the interiors of the Lion City's cars with
        quality leather upholstery. Our Co-Presidents poured their heart and soul into the business
        and built their reputation bit by bit, attracting more customers each day. To keep quality
        leather seats a luxury that everyone can afford to enjoy, Five Star established a
        manufacturing base in Batam, employing talented employees sewing each stitch with care. Our
        Singapore experts are in charge of assembling the new seats and performing quality checks.
